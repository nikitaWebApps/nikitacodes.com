## Context and Problem

Each month, the company schedules training seminars and webinars for specialists. Information about these events was sent to partners in the form of a PDF file via messengers. Screenshots of individual events were then posted in stories and shared among clients. It looked something like this:

<Image src={pic1} alt={''} />

Obviously, there are problems with this scenario: the text is too small, and the information does not fit on one screen.

## Solution

We decided to transfer the information from the general table to the website, adapting it for mobile devices. I also added various button display logics so that people could immediately register for the events.

## How I Worked on the Design

A clearly defined problem requiring a solution greatly helped in the development. I highlighted the following design requirements:

- **Mobile First.** The main usage scenario is to share a link in stories or in a messenger.
- **Main information** should fit on one screen. Many partners are used to posting screenshots with seminar information in stories. It was necessary to keep this possibility, so I planned the layout in such a way that the main information would fit in height on one smartphone screen.
- **Scalability.** The number of events will grow, and the user should quickly read the information about the date, city, and seminar topic.

When opening the site, the user can quickly scan the date and topic of the webinar. If interested, they expand the card to read more detailed information.

The data in the cards are uniform, and during a quick scroll, it can be difficult to determine where one card ends and another begins. I decided to alternate the card colors to make it easier to navigate the page.

##  Development

The data on the site needs to be updated, and the question arose of how to do this most conveniently. So that my colleagues wouldn’t have to learn a new tool, we decided to use Google Sheets for entering information. The framework Nuxt, which works with Vue.js, helps to transform the data from the table. It's enough to simply drop the CSV file into the /content folder and write a query.

Working with a declarative framework makes it convenient to write custom logic for displaying elements. For example, the registration button for webinars is displayed if the main landing page is already updated and the user is viewing the page before the webinar has passed. When clicking the “Message the Manager” button, a message text with the event date is dynamically generated.

> During the development stage, I added the function to copy the link to a specific card. When following such a link, the user’s screen will immediately “scroll” to the desired card. This can be useful when someone shares an announcement in stories.


## What I Learned


**Nuxt.** This is the first project where I used Nuxt in addition to Vue. Thanks to the well-written documentation, it didn't take me much time to figure out its setup.

**TypeScript.** Nuxt quite well types the initial data and suggests some values, but not always. I tried to specify types for the data and functions I wrote myself: this helps not to get confused in the project, especially over time.
