## Task

Development of a website for the consulting company "ACHE-ru." On this project, I worked as both a developer and project manager. The design, image selection, and technical text analysis were performed by Angelina Chuprina. By the way, here is her [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angechuprina/)

## Stack

As the CMS, I used WordPress so that the company could manage document uploads independently. For styling, I used **Sass** in combination with the **BEM** methodology. All interactive elements on the site were written in **pure JavaScript.**

## Development Process

After receiving the mockups, I created static pages and tested their responsiveness. Then I created a custom theme and used **PHP** to add dynamic elements to the pages. This allowed for code reuse for repeating elements or to set conditions for displaying certain blocks.

I strive to maximize the capabilities provided by the framework. For example, simple HTML validation is used for the front-end form. Since this validation can be easily bypassed, the main validation occurs on the server. I wrote logic that checks the entered data and immediately sends a notification in case of an error. The data is also sanitized to remove any potentially harmful code.

For building the project, I decided to use **Vite.** This allowed me to immediately get the final minified js and css files and use them right away.

## What I Learned

**Working with a designer.** Usually, I prepared the mockups myself and understood the level of detail I needed: I knew how elements should work and didn't need detailed designs. On this project, my design experience helped work more efficiently: Angelina didn't have to create pixel-perfect mockups because I knew how spacing systems worked and could suggest how to optimize or rework some components for easier layout.
