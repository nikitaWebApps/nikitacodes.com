		</p>
		<p class='text-slate-800 mb-4'>
			In my work, I use a product-oriented approach and always start by understanding the task. I ask clarifying
			questions, and if I see that something can be improved, I suggest options. I constantly develop in my profession:
			I try new technologies, delve into documentation, follow experts on YouTube, and read Reddit. In my free time, I
			make hobby projects to learn Laravel and play drums.
